# CondMatLab @ SISSA
All the scripts&codes for the 1st term courses I have taken at SISSA [2019/20 - PhD Program in Cond. Mat. Th.].
Almost everything is coauthored, so no license is provided.

Brief description of the contenent:

- *SolidStateLab* consists of three distinct projects, tackled within the *Solid-State Problems* course given by prof. Stefano de Gironcoli (https://people.sissa.it/~degironc/) at SISSA. Main focus is electronic structure theory, ranging from more-or-less-realistic tight binding calculations on 2D materials to berry-phase-related properties of minimalistic topological models. The final problem set on lattice dynamics shifts towards a more quantitative point of view, focusing on accurate reproduction of experimental literature.

- *HFHubbardLab* is a mostly theoretical training on static mean-field (*aka* Hartree Fock) treatment of Hubbard models. Nevertheless some interesting numerical aspects arise as stability of the self-consistency loop is concerned (mainly around first-order critical lines, where the loop may converge on metastable solutions). The correspondent course has been given at SISSA by prof. Massimo Capone (https://cm.sissa.it/people/members.php?ID=5).

- *HeisenbergED* is an exact diagonalization training on spin-1/2 XXX model, focusing on Sz- and momentum- sectors selection as a physics-informed path for the block-reduction of the many-body eigenproblem. Due to prohibitive scaling of Hilbert space dimension special attention has been devoted to memory managment and fast build of matrices, following closely the standard reference hosted at https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3281. Furthermore a statistical analysis based on *Phys. Rev. B 75, 155111 (2007)* has been carried on the ED results. The correspondent course has been given at SISSA by prof. Mario Collura (https://cm.sissa.it/people/members.php?ID=2503).
