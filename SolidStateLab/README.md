**SolidStateLab** consists of three distinct projects, tackled within the infamous *Solid-State Problems* course given by prof. Stefano de Gironcoli at SISSA. Main focus is electronic structure theory, ranging from more-or-less-realistic tight binding calculations on 2D materials to berry-phase-related properties of minimalistic topological models. The final problem set on lattice dynamics shifts towards a more quantitative point of view, focusing on accurate reproduction of experimental literature.

Here everything is heavily coauthored. In particular:

- The *Graphene&Beyond* project has been carried out together with [Ali Khosravi](mailto:ali.khosravi@sissa.it) as the perfect coding-mate and [Guglielmo Lami](mailto:glami@sissa.it) as "the mathemagician".
- The *TopologicalMatter* project has been mainly coded by [Guglielmo Lami](mailto:glami@sissa.it) and [Pietro Torta](mailto:ptorta@sissa.it), the true experts of Wolfram language here. I faked as the "berryology expert"; and did all the plotting.
- The *SolidArgonPhonons* project has been contributed by [Nishan Ranabhat](mailto:nranabha@sissa.it), though he has been focusing mainly on the formal calculations. Strictly-speaking-coding has been carried out mostly by myself.
